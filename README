GREE Bootcamp1 Memo : Kanatatsuki

This this the first time for me touch web service and GREE app.
The Web set up on Phpfog used a php web template.

The Steps Memo:

(1) install Ruby for mac( including Xcode CML, homebrew, libksba and RVM )
(2) create and php web using Phpfog with af cml tool
(3) writing the gadget.xml
(4) create an testing app on GREE, and link with gadget.xml in (3)
(5) test the app in GREE sandbox
(6) upload the files to Github

From this progress, I got a basic idea of GREE app Development progress, got in to the world of Web Service and Had much fun.
